      Left-click the menu bar icon to toggle, right-click for the menu.
      The first toggle asks for your password once, to install
      /etc/sudoers.d/lidawake (it only allows pmset disablesleep 0/1).

      For heat and battery alerts on your phone, install the ntfy app
      and choose "Phone Alerts..." from the menu.

      Before uninstalling, turn lid sleep back on and remove the rule:
        sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0
        sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/lidawake
